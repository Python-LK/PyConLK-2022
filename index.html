                       <p>Sorting is one of those things that we take for granted in Python. The built-in "sorted"
                           unction knows how to sort any iterable of objects that are themselves sortable.
                       </p>
                        <p>But hiding behind that simple description is a great deal of depth. In this talk, I'll go
                            deep into what it means to sort, and how we can sort any collection of Python data. We'll
                            see how you can use custom functions to sort built-in data structures in new and interesting
                            ways. And we'll see how you can design your own custom classes such that they will sort in
                            just the way you want.
                        </p>
                        <p>After watching this talk, you'll have a better understanding of sorting, built-in data
                            structures, function objects, and how "magic methods" affect the our Python classes.
                            Moreover, you'll be able to write clearer, shorter, and more easily understood code.

                       <p>A ton of automation can be done by knowing a little bit of python. Some of the everyday tasks

                       <p>“All the cool kids are using FastAPI for web development.” Imagine hearing this just as you
                           start getting more comfortable using other frameworks, like Django or Flask, to build your
                           web app. </p>
                        <p>There's a new kid on the block. In this talk, let's walk through how to build a simple web
                            application with FastAPI that transcribes sports audio in real-time.</p>
                        <p>What is Fast API? </p>
                        <p>Fast API (aka the new kid) is a modern Python framework that takes all your favorite features
                            from other tools and combines them into one. It's built for speed, rapid development, and
                            enhanced developer experience.</p>
                        <p>By the end, you'll have a much better understanding of how to use FastAPI in your next
                            project.</p>
                        <P>This talk is for developers of all levels, including beginners.</P>

                       <p>Python introduced gradual typing with the mypy tool in 3.5. It has received mixed opinions in
                           the community. As the code base grows over time, typing becomes an important tool to maintain
                           code-quality and improve developer productivity. </p>
                        <p>The talk will introduce the audience to gradual typing in Python and focus on adding
                            type-hints to Django using <a href="https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs">Django stubs</a>,

                       <p class="abstract-author">by - Sebastiaan Zeeff</p>
                       <p>Driven by the immense popularity of asynchronous frameworks, such as FastAPI, asynchronous
                           database support became a hot topic in the Python community. As talking to your database
                           often forms a significant portion of the input and output of your application, it's important
                           to do that asynchronously as well. With the release of version 1.4, SQLAlchemy added support
                           for Asynchronous I/O for both its core and ORM features. This means that you can now use the
                           popular SQL toolkit for Python in your asynchronous applications.
                       </p>
                        <p>In my talk, I will introduce you to the newly added support for asyncio in SQLAlchemy. I
                            will go over how easy it is to set up the new AsyncEngine, point you to some of the
                            differences with synchronous SQLAlchemy, and show you some of the pitfalls to avoid.
                            In addition, I will also show you how you can run your existing synchronous SQLAlchemy code
                            asynchronously to help you transition to a fully asynchronous application. By the end of my
                            talk, you should know enough to start your own asynchronous SQLAlchemy adventure.

                       <p class="abstract-author">by - Paolo Melchiorre</p>
                       <p>Every time we’re going to create a new project with Django we make assessments on its
                           requirements to choose the best architecture, of which, the database is usually the core.
                       </p>
                        <p>Django is a database-agnostic web framework but natively supports only4 Open Source
                            databases: PostgreSQL, SQLite, MariaDB and MySQL. PostgreSQL has the richest feature set
                            of any supported database and some of these features are natively supported directly in
                            Django via its contrib module.
                        </p>
                        <p>In this talk we’ll see how to use to our advantage the features of PostgreSQL as a database
                            in Django, its exclusive features present in its contrib module and also other superpowers
                            that can be exploited through the use of third-party packages.

                       <p>Natural language is about texts, alphabets, words, sentences, numbers, special characters,
                           emoticons - in a nutshell, every way we express our thoughts. But machine learning is about
                           only and only numbers. This use-case walk-through focuses on an advanced technique that helps
                           us represent natural language as numbers, called word vectors or embeddings, to apply machine
                           learning and build text classification models. </p>

            <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
        </div>
        <p>All attendees, speakers, Partners and volunteers at our conference are kindly
            asked to adopt the following code of conduct, and are required to agree to the
            Anti-Harassment Policy. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to
            help ensure a safe and comfortable environment for everybody.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">The Quick Version</h3>
        <p>Be friendly, patient, welcoming and considerate; be respectful, use appropriate
            language, and avoid discriminatory behavior or expressions. In particular,
            harassment is unacceptable; our conference is dedicated to providing a
            harassment free conference experience for everyone, and participants violating
            the Anti-Harassment Policy may be sanctioned or even expelled from the
            conference, at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">The Full Version</h3>

        <p>Be friendly and welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds
            and identities.</p>

        <p>Be patient and considerate. We all want to have fun teaching and learning, and a cooperative atmosphere will
            make us more productive.</p>

        <p>Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and
            poor manners. Refrain from personal attacks, and be respectful when dealing with other members of the Python
            community as well as with people outside it.</p>

        <p>Use appropriate language, and avoid discriminatory behavior. Everybody is welcome to this conference,
            regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
            appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion (or lack thereof).</p>

        <p>We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Organisers will enforce the
            Anti-Harassment Policy throughout the event.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Anti-Harassment Policy</h3>

        <p>Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
            orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion (or lack thereof);
            deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
            talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and
            imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties and online
            media. </p>

        <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. </p>

        <p>Partners are also subject to the Anti-Harassment Policy. In particular, Partners should not use sexualised
            images, activities, or other material. </p>

        <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem
            appropriate, including warning the offender or even expulsion from the conference. </p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Need Help?</h3>

        <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
            contact a member of conference staff immediately.</p>
