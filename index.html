                                programming – so that he could solve more problems. He also loves sharing knowledge, and
                                that is why he spends so much time writing articles in his blog <a

                                His main areas of scientific interest are mathematics (numerical analysis in particular)
                                and programming in general (with a preference for the Python and APL languages), but
                                Rodrigo also enjoys reading fantasy books, watching silly comedy movies and eating

        <p>All attendees, speakers, Partners and volunteers at our conference are kindly
            asked to adopt the following code of conduct, and are required to agree to the
            Anti-Harassment Policy. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to
            help ensure a safe and comfortable environment for everybody.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">The Quick Version</h3>
        <p>Be friendly, patient, welcoming and considerate; be respectful, use appropriate
            language, and avoid discriminatory behavior or expressions. In particular,
            harassment is unacceptable; our conference is dedicated to providing a
            harassment free conference experience for everyone, and participants violating
            the Anti-Harassment Policy may be sanctioned or even expelled from the
            conference, at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">The Full Version</h3>

        <p>Be friendly and welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds
            and identities.</p>

        <p>Be patient and considerate. We all want to have fun teaching and learning, and a cooperative atmosphere will
            make us more productive.</p>

        <p>Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and
            poor manners. Refrain from personal attacks, and be respectful when dealing with other members of the Python
            community as well as with people outside it.</p>

        <p>Use appropriate language, and avoid discriminatory behavior. Everybody is welcome to this conference,
            regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
