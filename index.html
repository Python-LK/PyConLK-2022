                                that is why he spends so much time writing articles in his blog <a href="http://mathspp.com/blog">mathspp.com/blog</a>,
                                writing on Twitter @mathsppblog, and giving workshops and courses.</p>

                                <p>His main areas of scientific interest are mathematics (numerical analysis in particular)
                                and programming in general (with a preference for the Python and APL languages), but
                                Rodrigo also enjoys reading fantasy books, watching silly comedy movies and eating
                                chocolate.</p>

				   <p class="abstract-author">by - Sangwon and Stephan</p>
                   <p>The world of software engineering is undergoing radical change, software written in the classical computing style is rapidly giving way to those powered by AI/ML/Statistical Inference models.  A key element in this transformation is the field of Data Engineering.  In this presentation, we will discuss how data engineering is the key component in the success of AI/ML projects from both a business and technical perspective.  We will survey new business and organizational needs for AI/ML solutions, and present core concepts and tools used to manage complex data transformation workflows with particular emphasis on the role of Python and Directed Acyclic Graphs.</p>

                       <p class="abstract-author">by - Bargava Subramanian</p>
                       <p>Radiology is a critical field in modern medicine, but it faces a major challenge: the growing demand for diagnostic imaging services is outpacing the availability of trained radiologists. In this talk, we will explore how Python and AI help scale radiology to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population. The talk will discuss how to use Python to develop efficient and effective algorithms to analyze medical images, and how AI,  both computer vision and natural language processing, is used to automate and optimize radiology workflows. The speaker will also show how to build quick internal apps using Python to improve the accuracy and speed of diagnostic imaging.</p>

                       <p>Generative AI has taken over 2023. This talk is centered around how to access OpenAI's generative AI models (GPT3 and ChatGPT) and use them for this case of generating a profile summary based on the information you provide. It is surprising how the models respond to different elements in the prompt. Along with this, I will demonstrate how to build a basic Streamlit WebApp and parse PDFs using PDFPlumber to feed information to your webapp.</p>

                       <p>The amount of actionable data that is available for organisations has exploded in the last two decades. This explosion has led to a brand new opportunity in terms of harnessing this data to extract value to business. In this talk, the speaker describes how Apache Spark, a big data technology that has a Python programming interface, can be utilised to build big data products. The Speaker will lay the foundations to the topic by defining what big data is and how big data is created in the real world. Then he explains the architecture of Apache Spark and how Spark can be used to leverage distributed computing that is pivotal when working with giga/tera and peta-byte scale data. The basic API of PySpark, the python interface of Apache Spark will be presented with coding examples to demonstrate how to develop big data applications. Finally, the talk will conclude by giving a glimpse into Spark ML, the distributed machine learning package shipped with Apache Spark.</p>

                       <p>Modules are a key feature of Python, allowing us to easily reuse our own code and take advantage of publicly available modules from PyPI. It's a rare program that doesn't include at least one ""import"" statement. But what actually happens when we import a module? How does Python find our file? How does it decide whether it should even try to find our module? And after it finds our module file, how does Python load it into memory, assigning to its attributes?</p>
                       <p>In this talk, I'll walk you through what happens when you ""import"" a module into Python. The mechanism is surprisingly complex, in no small part because it has to take so many possibilities into consideration. We'll talk about finders and loaders, and about the many ways in which you can customize the module-loading mechanism if you find a need to do so.</p>
                       <p>If you've ever imported a module, then this talk will pull back the curtain a bit, helping you to understand what's happening under the hood.</p>

                       <p>With current advances in Software engineering, we’re going through multiple abstraction levels when developing solutions. So it’s easy to forget that we still have limited resources. Further, code performance has real-world implications. A few milliseconds of delay can mean a significant drop in the conversion rate. So code optimization is still a very relevant topic. Optimization also means how, when, and where you allocate your (developer) time optimally to optimize your code. This is where you hear a lot of words like Premature optimizations, Micro optimizations, etc. This talk will be focusing on micro-optimizations (the root of all evil). But we’re specifically talking about some good habits you and your team can develop so you will write non-ugly code. The main idea of doing this is that, without effort, you can write good enough code, so you won’t have to worry about micro-optimizations in the future.</p>

                       <p>Have you ever wondered why there is no switch-case statement in python and googled for it? If you did it after the python 3.10 release you might probably get pointed towards “match-case” in python. I think it is one of the most underrated features in python because many of us try to use it as an alternative to simple switch-case in other languages. But it has more potential than that whilst you can't expect any real performance benefits from replacing a few if-elif statements. In this talk we will discuss how match-case actually works and its advanced usages. After this talk you will be able to effectively use “match-case” in your programs.</p>

                       <p>Descriptors are one of those things that many don't even bother to learn because they look confusing.
Thankfully for you, I figured out how descriptors work 20 minutes ago, so there is no one better prepared to teach you descriptors than someone who _just_ learned how they work.

In this talk I will provide an example that shows how descriptors work and that will also motivate why they are useful and needed.

By the time we are done, you will be able to implement descriptors in your code, use them for practical purposes and, most importantly, you will be able to deliver a talk just like mine!

The talk will be easier to follow if you are familiar with how properties work (via the `@property` decorator).</p>
                        <p><strong>## Outline</strong></p>

<p>The outline of the talk is as follows:<br>

- using properties to implement getters for private attributes or attributes that are computed on the fly;<br>
- using properties to implement setters for those same attributes;<br>
- defining a bunch of similar properties;<br>
- using descriptors to abstract away the pattern that the properties follow;<br>
- descriptor `__get__`;<br>
- descriptor `__set__`; and<br>
- descriptor `__set_name__`.<br>
</p>
<p>The talk will start by going over the basics of properties, but it is does not provide a comprehensive introduction to Python properties.
Rather, it is meant as a refresher for someone who knows how to implement and use a property."</p>

                       <p>Modeling urban transport networks helps to better evaluate the performance of the network and propose
suitable traffic control measures. Developing accurate transport models requires a large amount of time as
i) it requires multiple data inputs in the model creation process, ii) proper calibration of model parameters
to match the ground truth. This session discuss how Python programming language can be used to
automate i) model creation, ii) model calibration (using stochastic approximation algorithms), iii) scenario
development, so that the time required for model development can be minimized while maintaining a
higher level of accuracy in the model. Real world applications with SUMO microscopic simulator and
PTV Visum macroscopic simulator will be discussed in this session.</p>

				   <p class="abstract-author">by - Dr.Patrick Kavanagh</p>
                   <p>The James Webb Space Telescope is a groundbreaking infrared observatory
resulting from an international collaboration between NASA, the European
Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency. It was successfully
launched December 2021 and is currently orbiting the L2 point 1.5
million km from Earth. Webb was designed to address some of the biggest
questions in astronomy and astrophysics, including identifying the first
stars in the Universe, observing the first galaxies, revealing the
initial stages of star and planet formation, and probing the composition
of exoplanet atmospheres. It has made unexpected and groundbreaking
discoveries almost routine in its first year of science operations. But
how do we go from the raw data collected by Webb to science-ready data
products delivered to astronomers and astrophysicists around the world?
 From the ambitious Webb Calibration Pipeline to post-pipeline data
analysis tools, the software suites that support these tasks are written
in Python. In this talk I will give an overview of Webb, the crucial
role of Python in Webb's development and data processing, why Python is
the language of choice, and I will present some highlights from the
first year of observations by this revolutionary telescope.</p>

            <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
        </div>
        <p>All attendees, speakers, Partners and volunteers at our conference are kindly
            asked to adopt the following code of conduct, and are required to agree to the
            Anti-Harassment Policy. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to
            help ensure a safe and comfortable environment for everybody.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">The Quick Version</h3>
        <p>Be friendly, patient, welcoming and considerate; be respectful, use appropriate
            language, and avoid discriminatory behavior or expressions. In particular,
            harassment is unacceptable; our conference is dedicated to providing a
            harassment free conference experience for everyone, and participants violating
            the Anti-Harassment Policy may be sanctioned or even expelled from the
            conference, at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">The Full Version</h3>

        <p>Be friendly and welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds
            and identities.</p>

        <p>Be patient and considerate. We all want to have fun teaching and learning, and a cooperative atmosphere will
            make us more productive.</p>

        <p>Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and
            poor manners. Refrain from personal attacks, and be respectful when dealing with other members of the Python
            community as well as with people outside it.</p>

        <p>Use appropriate language, and avoid discriminatory behavior. Everybody is welcome to this conference,
            regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
            appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion (or lack thereof).</p>

        <p>We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Organisers will enforce the
            Anti-Harassment Policy throughout the event.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Anti-Harassment Policy</h3>

        <p>Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
            orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion (or lack thereof);
            deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
            talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and
            imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties and online
            media. </p>

        <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. </p>

        <p>Partners are also subject to the Anti-Harassment Policy. In particular, Partners should not use sexualised
            images, activities, or other material. </p>

        <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem
            appropriate, including warning the offender or even expulsion from the conference. </p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Need Help?</h3>

        <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
            contact a member of conference staff immediately.</p>
